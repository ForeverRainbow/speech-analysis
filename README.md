## Description

This project is an attempt at making a software capable of analysing speech signals in real-time.
The main focus as of writing this description is on pitch detection and formant analysis.
Feel free to report any bugs, request new features, or critique existing ones in the Issues section.

This is the web app branch (version) of the app.
